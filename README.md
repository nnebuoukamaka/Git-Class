Version Control is the process of tracking and managing changes to files.(code). It is otherwise known as Source Control. Also important to this concept is version control systems and cloud repositories where we can save the changes we make to our files. Version control systems are systems that record and track changes to a file or set of files, so as to be able to retrieve any specific version of the data.

Git is a version control system. It is used for tracking code changes, who made the changes and for coding collaboration. GitHub is a cloud repository. It is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. With a platform such as GitHub developers can collaborate on projects from anywhere in the world.

Other such platforms fro version control include: GitLab, AWS CodeCommit, Beanstalk etc 

git fetch and git pull are two similar commands but they both carry out different functions. git pull copies changes from a remote repository directly into your working repository (in your local machine), but git fetch only copies the changes from a remote repository into your local git repo . In simple terms, git fetch is more like just checking to see if there are any changes available while git pull on the other hand does that AND still brings (copies) those changes from the remote repository.

Git Rebase allows one to integrate the changes from one branch into another. A Git rebase changes the base of the developer's branch from one commit to another. It rewrites commit history. The command for this action  is git rebase

Cherry picking is the act of picking a commit from a branch and applying it to another. cherry-pick enables arbitrary Git commits to be picked by reference and appended to the current working HEAD. The command is git cherry-pick
